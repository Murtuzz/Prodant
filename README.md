# Prodant
	It's not a secret that India has problems when it comes to the safety of women.
  While the government has been taking steps to address the issue after horrific incidents and widespread protests, sexual crimes   apparently continue to occur and itâ€™s an urge to protect them. 
 So we thought of making a device that will make them feel safer when she feels any unknown activity around her. 
 Just pressing prodant your phone emits a loud alarm to scare away attackers and sends your location to your selected guardians who can be friends, family members.
 The objective of making Prodant is to reduce the number of crimes happening against women's.
 The cost will be very feasible so that anyone can buy it as well as very easy to use.
 It is capable of working without internet in no network area.
 It is useful for every female as well as it is sweat, rain and splash proof.
 Prodant requires no charging. Replaceable button cell batteries lasts up to 6 months.
